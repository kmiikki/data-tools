# data-tools

Command-line tools for data processing, smoothing, and visualization in scientific and engineering workflows.

This repository collects small, self-contained Python utilities developed for research data analysis,
sensor calibration, and image- or signal-based measurement workflows.  
Each tool lives in its **own subdirectory** with its own script, documentation, and examples.

## ðŸ§© Key Principles

- **Reproducible:** all tools use clear command-line interfaces with explicit parameters.  
- **Lightweight:** minimal dependencies â€“ NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy.  
- **Self-contained:** each directory includes its own `README.md`, `algorithm.md`, and main script.  
- **Modular:** tools are independent; they can be used separately or combined in workflows.
